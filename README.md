# It should work
there are some issues with the file name. it should be normal, without any special chars like (file (1).bmp, etc.) A file like test.bmp will work from what i've tested.

also, a issue which i couldnt figure out: if i navigate to localhost:5432 for the svelte app, it doesnt work in a normal browser, it only works in incognito? (using wsl)
